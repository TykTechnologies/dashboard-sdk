            ## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

            The Tyk Dashboard API offers granular, programmatic access to a centralised database of resources that your Tyk nodes can pull from. This API has a dynamic user administrative structure which means the secret key that is used to communicate with your Tyk nodes can be kept secret and access to the wider management functions can be handled on a user-by-user and organisation-by-organisation basis.

            A common question around using a database-backed configuration is how to programatically add API definitions to your Tyk nodes, the Dashboard API allows much more fine-grained, secure and multi-user access to your Tyk cluster, and should be used to manage a database-backed Tyk node.

            The Tyk Dashboard API works seamlessly with the Tyk Dashboard (and the two come bundled together).

            ## <a name="security-hierarchy"></a> Security Hierarchy

            The Dashboard API provides a more structured security layer to managing Tyk nodes.

            ### Organisations, APIs and Users

            With the Dashboard API and a database-backed Tyk setup, (and to an extent with file-based API setups - if diligence is used in naming an creating definitions), the following security model is applied to the management of Upstream APIs:

            * **Organisations**: All APIs are *owned* by an organisation, this is designated by the `OrgID` parameter in the API Definition.
            * **Users**: All users created in the Dashboard belong to an organisation (unless an exception is made for super-administrative access).
            * **APIs**: All APIs belong to an Organisation and only Users that belong to that organisation can see the analytics for those APIs and manage their configurations.
            * **API Keys**: API Keys are designated by organisation, this means an API key that has full access rights will not be allowed to access the APIs of another organisation on the same system, but can have full access to all APIs within the organisation.
            * **Access Rights**: Access rights are stored with the key, this enables a key to give access to multiple APIs, this is defined by the session object in the core Tyk API.

            In order to use the Dashboard API, you'll need to get the `Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials` secret from your user profile on the Dashboard UI.

            The secret you set should then be sent along as a header with each Dashboard API Request in order for it to be successful:

            ```
            authorization: <your-secret>
            ```

                                                                Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                                As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                                As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                Updating will completely replace the file descriptor and will not change an API Definition that has already been loaded. The hot-reload endpoint will need to be called to push the new definition to live.

                                                                Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                                As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                                  a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                                 - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                                  a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                                Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                                Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                                 - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                                As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                                The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                                As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                            Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                                            limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                                            spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making

                                                            Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                                            following events is emitted:

                                                            - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                                            - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                                            Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                                            - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                                            - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                                            - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                                            - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                                            - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                                            To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                                            `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                                            the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                                            emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                                            Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                                            will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                                            drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                                            `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                                            decreased by `step`.

                                                            After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                                            rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                                            required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                                            hold-off.

                                                            For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                                             - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                                              a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                             - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                              a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                            Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                            To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                             - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                             - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                            Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                            To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                             - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                             - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                            As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                            The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                                            defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                                            internally every `delay` seconds.

                                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                                    following events is emitted:

                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                                    decreased by `step`.

                                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                                    hold-off.

                                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                                    internally every `delay` seconds.

                                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                                    following events is emitted:

                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                                    decreased by `step`.

                                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                                    hold-off.

                                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                                    internally every `delay` seconds.

                    Updating an API definition uses the same signature object as a `POST`. It will first ensure that the API ID being updated is the same as in the `PUT` object.
                    Updating will completely replace the file descriptor and will not change an API Definition that has already been loaded. The hot-reload endpoint will need to be called to push the new definition to live.

                                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                                    following events is emitted:

                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                                    decreased by `step`.

                                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                                    hold-off.

                                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                                    internally every `delay` seconds.

                                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                                    following events is emitted:

                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                                    decreased by `step`.

                                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                                    hold-off.

                                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                                    internally every `delay` seconds.

                                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                                    following events is emitted:

                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                                    decreased by `step`.

                                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                                    hold-off.

                                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                                    internally every `delay` seconds.

                to: |
                    These APIS helps you get,add and delete (CRUD) a list of additional (custom) permissions for your Dashboard users. You can use the created additional permissions with Open Policy Agent (OPA) <br/>

                     Once created, a custom permission will be added to standard list of user permissions. <br/>

                    You can also configure these custom permissions in the security.additional_permissions map in the Tyk Dashboard configuration file.

                    You can check the [full documentation here](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-dashboard-api/org/permissions/).

                    Currently tyk dashboard only support API template assets.An API template is an asset managed by Tyk Dashboard that is used as the starting point - a blueprint - from which you can create a new Tyk OAS API definition. <br/>

                    Templates are used only during the creation of an API, they cannot be applied later.

                    [Read more about API template assets here](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-dashboard/advanced-configurations/templates/template-overview/)
        Open Policy Agent:

                to: |
                    The Tyk Dashboard permission system can be extended by writing custom rules using an Open Policy Agent (OPA). The rules engine works on top of your Dashboard API, which means you can control not only access rules, but also behaviour of all Dashboard APIs (except your public developer portal)  <br/>

                    By default the Dashboard OPA engine is turned off, and you need to explicitly enable it via your Dashboard tyk_analytics.conf file. <br/>

                    You can use Opa rule to accomplish tasks like: <br/>

                    1. Prevent users from creating keyless apis.
                    2. Assign specific categories to apis created to certain user groups or users
                    3. Control access for individual fields. For example, do not allow changing the API “active” status (e.g. deploy), unless you have a specific permission set
                    4. And many more <br/>

                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                    following events is emitted:

                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                    decreased by `step`.

                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                    hold-off.

                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                    internally every `delay` seconds.

                                                Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                                limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                                spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                                abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                                Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                                following events is emitted:

                                                - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                                - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                                Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                                - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                                - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                                - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                                - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                                - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                                To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                                `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                                the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                                emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                                Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                                will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                                drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                                `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                                decreased by `step`.

                                                After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                                rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                                required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                                hold-off.

                                                For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                                 - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                                  a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                                 - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                                  a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                                Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                 - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                 - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                 - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                 - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                                defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                                internally every `delay` seconds.

                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                    following events is emitted:

                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                    decreased by `step`.

                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                    hold-off.

                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                    internally every `delay` seconds.

                        Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                        limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                        spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                        abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                        Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                        following events is emitted:

                        - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                        - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                        Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                        - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                        - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                        - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                        - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                        - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                        To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                        `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                        the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                        emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                        Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                        will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                        drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                        `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                        decreased by `step`.

                        After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                        rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                        required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                        hold-off.

                        For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                         - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                          a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                         - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                          a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                        Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                        To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                         - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                         - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                        Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                        To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                         - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                         - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                        As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                        The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                        defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                        internally every `delay` seconds.

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                                                 - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                                                 - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                                                Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                                                To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                                                 - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                                                 - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                                                As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                                                The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the

                                    Rate Limit Smoothing is a mechanism to dynamically adjust the request rate
                                    limits based on the current traffic patterns. It helps in managing request
                                    spikes by gradually increasing or decreasing the rate limit instead of making
                                    abrupt changes or blocking requests excessively.

                                    Once the rate limit smoothing triggers an allowance change, one of the
                                    following events is emitted:

                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingUp` when the allowance increases
                                    - `RateLimitSmoothingDown` when the allowance decreases

                                    Events are emitted based on the configuration:

                                    - `enabled` (boolean) to enable or disable rate limit smoothing
                                    - `threshold` after which to apply smoothing (minimum rate for window)
                                    - `trigger` configures at which fraction of a step a smoothing event is emitted
                                    - `step` is the value by which the rate allowance will get adjusted
                                    - `delay` is a hold-off in seconds providing a minimum period between rate allowance adjustments

                                    To determine if the request rate is growing and needs to be smoothed, the
                                    `step * trigger` value is subtracted from the request allowance and, if
                                    the request rate goes above that, then a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is
                                    emitted and the rate allowance is increased by `step`.

                                    Once the request allowance has been increased above the `threshold`, Tyk
                                    will start to check for decreasing request rate. When the request rate
                                    drops `step * (1 + trigger)` below the request allowance, a
                                    `RateLimitSmoothingDown` event is emitted and the rate allowance is
                                    decreased by `step`.

                                    After the request allowance has been adjusted (up or down), the request
                                    rate will be checked again over the next `delay` seconds and, if
                                    required, further adjustment made to the rate allowance after the
                                    hold-off.

                                    For any allowance, events are emitted based on the following calculations:

                                     - When the request rate rises above `allowance - (step * trigger)`,
                                      a RateLimitSmoothingUp event is emitted and allowance increases by `step`.
                                     - When the request rate falls below `allowance - (step + step * trigger)`,
                                      a RateLimitSmoothingDown event is emitted and allowance decreases by `step`.

                                    Example: Threshold: 400, Request allowance: 600, Current rate: 500, Step: 100, Trigger: 0.5.

                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingUp event, the request rate must exceed:

                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step * Trigger).
                                     - Example: 600 - (100 * 0.5) = `550`.

                                    Exceeding a request rate of `550` will increase the allowance to 700 (Allowance + Step).

                                    To trigger a RateLimitSmoothingDown event, the request rate must fall below:

                                     - Calculation: Allowance - (Step + (Step * Trigger)).
                                     - Example: 600 - (100 + (100 * 0.5)) = 450.

                                    As the request rate falls below 450, that will decrease the allowance to 500 (Allowance - Step).

                                    The request allowance will be smoothed between `threshold`, and the
                                    defined `rate` limit (maximum). The request allowance will be updated
                                    internally every `delay` seconds.
