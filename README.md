# Dashboard Sdks (Alpha)

- In an effort to reduce duplication of work we have generated the dashboard sdks that different teams can use instead
  of creating they own client .

- This is the dashboard sdk generated from the open Api specs.
- Report any issue you may encounter will using this Sdk as we plan to perfect them before making them public.
